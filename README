Due to the way postfix currently handles addrcpt (hardcoded to treat
it as a BCC), DSN should be disabled on the gateway to get non-delivery
reports (NDR) to work.

Either turn it off completely, by specifying

smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords		= dsn

Or selectivly by using a map

smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps	= cidr:smtp_discard_helo

$ cat smtp_discard_helo
127.0.0.1/32		dsn
192.168.248.12/32	dsn

I haven't seen any no documentation on what the recipient attributes
of addrcpt should be. In the absence of that, Postfix maintains
consistency with other Postfix features that add BCC recipients
(namely, always_bcc, sender_bcc_maps and recipient_bcc_maps).

Of course, any hard-coded policy should be made configurable,
but that does not help you now.

You can shut up Postfix about DSN attributes with:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
   smtp_discard_ehlo_keywords = dsn

or an equivalent smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps setting.

This means that down-stream MTAs will send delivery status
notifications. The local Postfix instance will not send notifications
until NOTIFY is made configurable for addrcpt and other BCC features.
